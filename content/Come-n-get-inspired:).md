Summary:  If you want to accomplish something, you need inspiration. Inspiration may come in the form of books, people, incidents etc. Certainly words of legends will help. All legends were winners one way or other way. “Winners don’t do different things, they do things differently”.

Here are some inspirational quotes of some computer tech giants.

**Linus Torvalds (Founder of linux):**

Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.

**Richard Stallman(Father of Free Software/Open Source):**

If you want to accomplish something in the world, idealism is not enough – you need to choose a method that works to achieve the goal.

**Bill Gates(Founder of Microsoft):**

It’s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.

**Steve Jobs (Founder of Apple):**

Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

**Larry Page(Co-founder of Google):**

If we were motivated by money, we would have sold the company a long time ago and ended up on a beach.
