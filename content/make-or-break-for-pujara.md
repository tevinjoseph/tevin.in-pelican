Summary: Sydney test will be in the headlines for many reasons, first test of Virat Kohli as India's full time skipper, Saha looks to step into the shoes of Dhoni as keeper. However, the test will be important for another individual who is none other than India's NO.3 [Cheteshwar Pujara](http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/32540.html). Pujara is the most talked and technically sound batsmen of current Indian team. What is so special about this young man? He has the ability to play long innings. When he hits hundred, he  makes sure it's big. He has scored 6 hundreds till date and four of them are 150+ scores with two double hundreds. ![enter image description here](http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/uy-2117571.jpg)

Pujara has an exceptional average of 75 in home tests. Even though, his career average still looks really good (47.11) he averages only 28.35 in away tests. Have a look at his averages in last 3 series'

    Newzeland: 15.00
    England: 22.20
    Austraila(on going series): 33.50

Things are not looking nice for India's No.3 who once compared with Rahul Dravid. His back foot play was found wanting of late. Clearly he struggled. Almost every game he got starts, but failed to convert all those. He scored only 2 fifties in the last 3 series'. He played county cricket for regainig form after the poor show in England but, unfortunately he hasn't played a defining Pujara innings yet in Australia.

May be he is one big innings away from regaining his touch. People like [Kedar Jadhav](http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/290716.html), [KL Rahul](http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/422108.html ) are pushing their cases to selectors. So, Sydney test will be make or break for Pujara. If he gets a good knock he will stay else he will found himself out of the test squad.
