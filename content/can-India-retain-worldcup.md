Summary: Of course, India have the ability to retain the world cup. The key players will be Kohli, Raina, Bhuveneswar Kumar and captain Dhoni himself. If Kohli is in full flow, no opposition can stop him. What is the specialty of this young champion player is he gets to good start, he makes sure he will be there at the end of the innings. Then comes Suresh Raina, he is a complete package for every captain. Brilliant fielder, Good batsman and partnership breaker too. ![enter image description here](http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ms-dhoni-suresh-raina-virat-kohli-and-bhuvneshwar-kumar.jpg)

If he gets a chance to bat NO.4 for above, I'm sure he will win a lot of matches for you.

We all know the finishing talent of Dhoni. He finishes things in style. His captaincy and keeping the wickets will be key for India.  On his day, no one can compete with Rohit Sharma. He has got some serious talent. If he can iron out his laziness, as kohli said earlier he will be X-factor for India in the world cup. I think Dhawan has  some problems against short pitch deliveries, but I believe he too can play a major role. Rahane/Rayidu will provide stability in the middle order. The likes of Aswin, Jadeja/Akshar patel can bat too.

I think only one of Aswin, Jadeja/Akshar patel will play in world cup because the pitches support more bounce. I would go with Akshar with his recent success. Bhuvi and Umesh Yadav will be key for India in bowling. Bhuvi can swing bowl in both ways and Umesh can bowl in express pace too. Varun Aron also can add variety too the Indian attack. Let's not forget Shami who is the highest wicket taker for India in recent times.

Now, with Raina, Kohli, Jadeja and Rahane India is world class fielding side. So, I believe this is a balanced side. The bouncy pitches are a bit of concern  but, Believe me, this guys won't disappoint you.
